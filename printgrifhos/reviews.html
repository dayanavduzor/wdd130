                    <h4>Angela:</h4>
                    <p>
                        On time and good work. I got personalized items for my wedding with a travel theme.
                        A large number of wedding favors, personalized napkins, invitations and placeholders cards 
                        for each of my guests were made. I was very satisfied with the services given. They helped 
                        me to get the designs exactly as I wanted them. They changed the design various times until 
                        I was happy with it. They were attentive, and respectful, very professional. I would Imprenta 
                        Grafhos recommend to anyone.

                    <p> Good quality. I ordered personal presentation cards for my business. You 
                        can choose silk printing style on your cards, which is handmade and fancy or you can choose 
                        digital prints for your cards which allows you to put pictures or color images on it. They 
                        have a variety of prices and quality varies depending on your budget.

                    <p>Good job done. I brought fabric napkins, balloons and glasses to personalize 
                        them, and also bought invitations. All those were for the quinceanera party of my daughter. 
                        My daughter chose her design and got what she wanted. The items were delivered on time 
                        and price was reasonable. </p>

                    <p>I have ordered my business-notes here for two years now. The owner is honest and respectful. 
                        My items are always on time, and the one time they were not going to give me the order on time, 
                        they called me and wanted to reimbursed me. I know the guys because I am a customer that comes 
                        every three months or so. They are very professional and good at communicating. They have a 
                        range of prices for everyone.</p>
