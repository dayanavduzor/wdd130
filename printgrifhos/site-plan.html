      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to attract and inform individuals
        who want to purchase or that are curious about the printing services
        offered by the shop. The website is needed and will be used to 
        spread the word about the quality of the products and also to 
        present ideas of what materials are possible to print on. The 
        experiences of the customers and also to display information of how
        to find the shop. Everything will be done in a way that is appealing
        to any who may come across with it. This will benefit the business 
        to communicate the value of what the company offers to the public 
        and to convey professionalism, build revenue and create a positive 
        opinion among the customers.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The Kind of people that are more likely to visit the website 
        are business owners looking for sale notes with or without folio, 
        signs, calendars and grocery bags for publicity. Also, people who 
        are looking to personalize items for special events like: weddings, 
        sweet sixteen parties, quincea√±era parties, birthdays etc. And at last, 
        the   students who sometimes are looking to print a variety of school 
        projects. We need to consider the different financial situations for 
        all these groups of people and that our audience usually could access 
        the site from a desktop, laptop or mobile devices. Having this in mind,
        we want to build a site that is inviting and appealing for these groups 
        of people.
