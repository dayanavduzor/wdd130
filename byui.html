            <a>Scriptures</a> #the a tag shows but they are not links. When we click on, nothing happens. We have to add an attribute to the opening a tag, that shows where to take the user when they click on the content. Let's also add a Home page link and then add attributes to each opening tag as follows.
            <a href="byui.html">Home</a>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org">Church of Jesus Christ</a>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples">Temples</a>
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures">Scriptures</a>   #Now when you look at the rendered page in the browser you can click the text content and it will take you to the right place because we added the href or hypertext reference value for each a link.
