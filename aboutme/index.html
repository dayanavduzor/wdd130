    <p> Hello class! </p>
    <p> I'm pursuing a career in applied technology and I want to become a web developer. I'm 29 years old.
        Since I'm sick with a chronic condition (since 4 years ago) I can not do much so, my hobbies right now 
        are to play the piano at home, to study scriptures or to learn things while sitting.When I feel good 
        I like cooking and exercising. I'm married with no children and my only occupation is to study 
        and be a homemaker. </p>

    <p> I want to graduate to help with income at home and also to help family or others. I want to become 
        better in my stewardship with all that God gives to me.I have been member of the church for 21 years 
        but I converted to the Lord when I was 17 years old.I don't have a favorite scripture but I often come 
        back to read the last verses of Galatians 5 becuase of the fruits of the flesh and the fruits of the 
        spirit. It helps me to  think about what fruits I'm giving from my heart. </p>

    <p> I'm excited for all the content in the class. I hope not be a bother if I fall behind with my limited
         udesrtanding but also to be helpful and serve you if I can help during the semester!</p>
